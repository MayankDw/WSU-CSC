Background 
----------
brief history of disciplines but not limited to.. that contributed ideas, viewpoints and the techniques to AI.. 

1) Aristotle (384 - 322 BC) was first to formulate a precise set of laws governing the rational part of minds. 
2) Ramon Llull (1232 - 1315) devised a system of reasoning published as Ars Magna or The Great Art (1305). Llull tried to implement 
   his system using an actual mechanical device: a set of paper wheels that could be rotation into different permutations. 
3) Leonardo da Vici(1452 - 1519) designed but didn't build a mechanical calculator. 
4) German Scientist Wilhelm schickard (1592-1635) constructed first knows calculating machine around 1623.
5) Bliase Pascal build Pascaline in 1642, and wrote that - it produces effects which appear nearer to thought thatn all the actions
   of animals."
6) Gottfried Whilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) built a mechanical devide intended to carry out operations on concepts rather than numbers 
   but its scope was rather limited. 
7) In 1651, in his book Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) suggested the idea of a thinking machine, an "artificial animal" in 
   his words, arguing " For what is the heart but a spring; and the nerves, but so many strings; and the joints, but so many wheels."
   He also suggested that reasoning was like numerical computation: "For 'reason' ... is nothing but 'reckoning' that is adding
   and subtracting."


Induction - David hume 1739, propsed what is now known as the principle of induction; - That general rules are acquired by exposure
to repeated associations between their elements. 

Confirmation Theory - Rudolf Carnap & Carl Hempel 1928
# Attempted to analyze the acquisition of knowledge from experience by quantifying the degree of belief that should assigned to 
  logical sentence based on their connection to observations that confirm or disconfirm them. 
# The final element in the philosophical picture of the mind is the connection between knowledge and action.
