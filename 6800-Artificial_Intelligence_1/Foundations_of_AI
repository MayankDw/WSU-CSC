Background 
----------
brief history of disciplines but not limited to.. that contributed ideas, viewpoints and the techniques to AI.. 

1) Aristotle (384 - 322 BC) was first to formulate a precise set of laws governing the rational part of minds. 
2) Ramon Llull (1232 - 1315) devised a system of reasoning published as Ars Magna or The Great Art (1305). Llull tried to implement 
   his system using an actual mechanical device: a set of paper wheels that could be rotation into different permutations. 
3) Leonardo da Vici(1452 - 1519) designed but didn't build a mechanical calculator. 
4) German Scientist Wilhelm schickard (1592-1635) constructed first knows calculating machine around 1623.
5) Bliase Pascal build Pascaline in 1642, and wrote that - it produces effects which appear nearer to thought thatn all the actions
   of animals."
6) Gottfried Whilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) built a mechanical devide intended to carry out operations on concepts rather than numbers 
   but its scope was rather limited. 
7) In 1651, in his book Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) suggested the idea of a thinking machine, an "artificial animal" in 
   his words, arguing " For what is the heart but a spring; and the nerves, but so many strings; and the joints, but so many wheels."
   He also suggested that reasoning was like numerical computation: "For 'reason' ... is nothing but 'reckoning' that is adding
   and subtracting."


Induction - David hume 1739, propsed what is now known as the principle of induction; - That general rules are acquired by exposure
to repeated associations between their elements. 

Confirmation Theory - Rudolf Carnap & Carl Hempel 1928
# Attempted to analyze the acquisition of knowledge from experience by quantifying the degree of belief that should assigned to 
  logical sentence based on their connection to observations that confirm or disconfirm them. 
# The final element in the philosophical picture of the mind is the connection between knowledge and action.

Computer Engineering
- The first operation computer was the elctromechanical Heath Robinson built in 1943 by Alan Turing's team for a single purpose; deciphering German messages. 
- In 1943, same team developed colossus, a powerful general purpose machine based on vaccum tubest. 
- The first electronic computer, the ABC, was assembled by John Atanasof and his student clifford berry between 1940 and 1942 at Iowa state University.
- ENIAC developed as part of a secret military project at the university of Pennsylvania by a team including John Macuhly and J. Presper Eckret, that provided 
  to be the most influential forerunner of modern computers. 

Moore's Law
- Each generation of computer hardware has brought an increase in speed and capacity and a decrease in price - trend captured in Moore's LAw. 
- Performance was doubled every every months or so until around 2005, when power dissipation problems led manufacturers to start multiplying the number of CPU cores rather than clock speed.
- A machine learning problem that took a whole day to train in 2014 takes only two mins in 2018. 
- Quantum computing holds out the promise of far greater accelerations for some important subclass of algorithms.

ROBOTIC VEHICLES: The history of robotic vehicles stretches back to radio-controlled
cars of the 1920s, but the first demonstrations of autonomous road driving without special
guides occurred in the 1980s (Kanade et al., 1986; Dickmanns and Zapp, 1987). After
successful demonstrations of driving on dirt roads in the 132-mile DARPA Grand Challenge
in 2005 (Thrun, 2006) and on streets with traffic in the 2007 Urban Challenge, the race to
develop self-driving cars began in earnest.
