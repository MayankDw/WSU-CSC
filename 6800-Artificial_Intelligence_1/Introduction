The computer would needs following capabilities 
# natural language processing to communicate successfully in a human language;
# knowledge representation to store what it knows or hears;
# automated reasoning to answer questions and to draw new conclusions;
# machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.

# Acting humanaly - Turing Test
# Thinking humanaly - Cognitive model approach.
# Thinking Rationally - Laws of thought approach inline with logic.
# Acting Rationally - The rational agent approach, which is an agent acting to achieve the best expected outcome. 

Agents : 
---------
Agent is something that acts - More specifically 
1) Operate autonomously, preceive their environment, persist over a prolonged time period, adapt a change, and create and pursue goals.
2) A rational agent is the one that acts to achieve the best outcome - In Principle, it allows the construction of a comprehensive model of rational thought, leading from raw perceptual
information to an understanding of how the world works to prediction about the future. 

- we don't want machines that are intelligent in the sense of persuing their objective; we want them to pursue our objectives. if we cannot transfer those objectives perfectly to the 
- machine, then we need a new formulation- one in which the machine is pursing the objective, but is necessarily uncertain as to what they are. When a machine knows that it doesn't know 
- the complete objective, it has an incentive to act cautiously, to ask permission, to learn more about our preferences through observation, and to defer to human control. Ultimately, 
- we want agents that are provably beneficial to humans.
