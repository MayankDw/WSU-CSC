The computer would needs following capabilities 
# natural language processing to communicate successfully in a human language;
# knowledge representation to store what it knows or hears;
# automated reasoning to answer questions and to draw new conclusions;
# machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.

# Acting humanaly - Turing Test
# Thinking humanaly - Cognitive model approach.
# Thinking Rationally - Laws of thought approach inline with logic.
# Acting Rationally - The rational agent approach, which is an agent acting to achieve the best expected outcome. 

Agents : 
---------
Agent is something that acts - More specifically 
1) Operate autonomously, preceive their environment, persist over a prolonged time period, adapt a change, and create and pursue goals.
2) A rational agent is the one that acts to achieve the best outcome - In Principle, it allows the construction of a comprehensive model of rational thought, leading from raw perceptual
information to an understanding of how the world works to prediction about the future.
